       or dissaproved by clicking this button in the image:</span>
       <img src="../../../assets/images/task_approval_or_dissaproval.JPG" alt="" srcset=""><br>
       a task dissaproved means staffs execution of that task was not good or task was not executed at all and this also reduces staffs salary.
        It simply reduces staffs salary by deducting the number of days in that month by the amout staff ought to earn for that month and then
        substracts it to staffs current salary remaining for that month.This way staffs will take task execution more seriously knowing
        the punishement that follows it. if that task is approved nothing happens only if staffs salary has been dissapproved
